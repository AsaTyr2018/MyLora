# 🔐 Security Policy

## Scope & Assumptions

MyLora is a **local-first tool** intended for **offline use only**. (For now)
It is **not designed to be hosted on public networks**, and we **do not guarantee security** when deployed outside a controlled environment.

## Versioning

MyLora does not use formal version numbers.  
Changes and updates are tracked via Git history and changelog entries.

## Reporting Security Concerns

Although this project is not meant for internet-facing use, we still appreciate responsible feedback.

If you believe you've found a **critical vulnerability** (e.g. arbitrary code execution in a plugin, insecure file handling, etc.), please report it **privately**:

📧 **github@lenz-service.de**  
(or reach out to @AsaTyr on GitHub)

We’ll try to:

- Acknowledge reports within **a few days**
- Investigate the concern
- Patch it if it affects typical offline usage

Please do **not** open public issues for security problems.

## Thank You

Thanks for caring about security, even in offline tools. You’re awesome.  
(And probably a bit paranoid. We like that.)
